<h3>
    New This Month on Being Yourself</h3>
<p>Forever Free of Brokenness
Are you willing to discover that you are already whole, no matter the state of your body, your mind, your thoughts, your emotions, or your circumstances?

While self-improvement can be very useful for your body and your mind, I can tell you with all confidence that if you think you have to fix yourself to come home to yourself, this is not true. It’s a dangerous lie that will cause you to suffer unnecessarily.

Since many of us live in a psycho/spiritual fix-it sub-culture, the possibility of stopping trying to fix ourselves can be felt as very threatening. Consequently, rather than investigating the possibility of real freedom, we continue with our habitual and often unconscious pursuit to improve our bodies, minds, and circumstances in the hope that this will somehow bring us closer to the truth.

To discover this eternal truth you must look into what is deeper and more present than even the functions of your body (the biggest identity that we have). You must look deeper than the functions of your mind (including your thoughts and emotions), and deeper than the particulars of your circumstances.

    If something in your life feels broken, I would say that it is absolutely appropriate and recommended that you work on fixing it. It’s appropriate to fix your body when it’s broken and unwell. It’s appropriate to fix your mind, including medication if it is necessary or helpful. Fix your circumstances if you are able. But no matter what your circumstances, or mental states, or body’s degree of sickness or health, what is always whole is always here—the endless ground of being, your own true presence. The truth of who you are is not subject to being broken and therefore not subject to being fixed.</p>

<p>Often when we feel prodded internally or externally to perfect and fix ourselves, it is actually a way of escaping the deep sense that something is missing, wrong, or incomplete, and we hope that if we can just somehow fill that black hole, the abyss of what it means to be an imperfect form, then we won’t be tormented. Yet all the while we are trying to fill this black hole, this abyss of perceived lack, we are overlooking what the discomfort is trying to call our attention to.

I invite you to stop telling whatever story you have of attainment or lack of attainment, whatever tales of success or failure, and simply turn your attention to this felt sense of imperfection. You are naturally already who you are. You have the full capacity to discover the immaculate fullness of who you truly are in the core. You don’t need to perfect anything to discover that. It’s already perfect.

    Gangaji will have a live online meeting on Sunday, December 8th at 4 PM Pacific Time that is exclusively dedicated to exploring this topic. Learn More about how to join</p>
<h3>Do You Want True Freedom Or Control?</h3>
by Gangaji

<h5>Ending Our Patterns of Unnecessary Suffering: Part III</h5>

<p>If what you are searching for is perfect safety, perfect comfort, a life that is dedicated to accumulating more and more personal power, then the freedom I am pointing to is not for you. The invitation to accept the treasure of a life lived in conscious awareness is not an invitation to safety and comfort. It is an invitation to live life fully and completely, which is never ultimately safe and is often uncomfortable.

    Power is mostly searched for because there is a belief that it will bring you comfort and safety, and this is turn will bring happiness and fulfillment: “If I am just safe enough, then I can relax.” But I am talking about recognizing that you can relax right now, even though you aren’t completely safe and you never will be. In that understanding is more than safety for the body, mind, or emotions. It is the realization of your very beingness, which is eternal.</p>

<p>The area where you do have some power and control, and which is too often overlooked, is in the choice of where you put your attention. You can choose to put attention on consciously recognizing what does not need to be controlled to be truly free, and you can support others in that.

If your attention is on the desire to control, your mind clutches at what you think must happen, should happen, or did happen. That clutching perpetuates suffering. If your desire is for true freedom rather than to control, you will catch the fire of truth. The mind will stop its clutching and will begin to open. What follows the natural opening of the mind is the most profound, the most mysterious, the most unspeakable realization.

As you investigate your attempts to control, ask yourself: What do I try to control? Be as honest as possible, and then even more honest. Be aware of any defenses to truly seeing, and be willing to drop these defenses. Perhaps you will uncover even more completely what has been hidden behind the closed doors of the mind. Through honest investigation these doors can open, offering a deep opportunity for surrender.

<h3>Discovering The Deepest Intimacy
    by Gangaji</h3>

<p>If in your heart there is a deep longing for intimacy, then don’t miss the opportunity to experience this longing directly, with no action taken to satiate it. The longing itself can speak to you of your true nature, of your hunger for what does not come and go.

The truth is that sexual intimacy is not necessary for the discovery of the deepest intimacy.

    True intimacy is endless. It has nothing to do even with being human. It is an intimacy with the whole universe. The true meaning of intimacy is an embrace of the universe with itself in all of its horror and all of its beauty—in love with itself and deeply intimate with itself.</p>

<p>Whether or not you ever have sex again, if you discover the truth of your being you have discovered infinite, unconditional fulfillment. No person and no particular act are needed for this. Experience the truth of yourself directly, and your relationship with yourself as a sexual being will never be the same or have the same power to cause suffering.

Causeless fulfillment is within you. As long as you have any misunderstanding that true fulfillment can be found outside you in some object, then you are chasing a false god. You can recognize that fulfillment is within, untouched by anything and always here for you, regardless of circumstances. Then the mind can cease its outward activity. You recognize the futility in these habits of reaching for “it” out there in some object or some activity. You recognize that what you want is here already.

    True identity, true fulfillment, waits for your discovery, is realized, and is a satisfaction beyond anything imaginable. It is the satisfaction of needing nothing, of love overflowing in the fulfillment of itself.</p>

<h5>Sexuality as Power</h5>

<p>One common way that sexuality gets distorted in our culture is to use it destructively as a platform for personal power. And an inescapable truth is that whenever we are doing harm to others, we are doing harm to ourselves. Obviously, when it comes to rape, rape is not just sexual; it’s a violent abuse of power. It’s an act of violence that uses sexuality as an outlet for rage and the need to feel powerful. And if you have ever experienced abuse, you know it’s not a question of surrendering your personal power; power is taken from you, and that’s the harm.

Another common misunderstanding is that people take freedom to mean free license for the physical body. While there can be an experience of relative freedom for the body in terms of physical circumstance, there is no possibility of absolute freedom for the physical body, so we can stop searching for everlasting freedom in regards to the body and its circumstances. The forces of nature imprison the physical body. There is no way out. The emotional body is imprisoned in feelings of “me! me! me!” The mental body is imprisoned in thoughts of “why? why? why?” True freedom is not about freedom of body, mind, or emotion. It is about recognizing what is beyond and untouched by body, mind, and emotion.

    If you are no longer identified with the body needing freedom, or the emotions needing freedom, or the mind needing freedom, then you realize absolute, everlasting freedom. There is a possibility to tell the truth about what your life has been about … and what you would like your life to be about now. Then, for at least an instant, whatever wheel of suffering we might have around sexuality is interrupted. Once it is interrupted by the light of conscious awareness, it doesn’t have the same power. The integrity of that particular pattern of suffering is broken, and from that point onward, real inquiry can begin.</p>
